As a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, Iâ€™m excited to bring my knowledge and passion to the tech industry. During my experience as a Software Development Intern and my time as a student, I have gained hands-on experience in programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, C#, and SQL, as well as web development technologies like Node.js, .NET, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am a fast learner with a passion for developing web applications that solve social problems. I'm seeking a role where I can apply my skills and contribute to the development of innovative software solutions. Let's connect and discuss how I can add value to your team!
