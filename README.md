I'm a Computer Science graduate with a minor in Mathematics, passionate about building scalable software solutions. I've gained hands-on experience through my roles at Crescent Bank and Chakra TechWorks, where I worked with AWS, Terraform, RESTful APIs, and full-stack technologies.

Skilled in Java, C++, Python, C#, SQL, and JavaScript, I enjoy creating applications that address real-world challenges. Whether it's automating infrastructure or crafting efficient backend systems, I bring a fast-learning mindset and a commitment to quality.
