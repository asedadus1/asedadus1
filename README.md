- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @asedadus1

In two years, I'll be celebrating my graduation from CSUSM as a student-athlete in cross country and track & field.
I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in math, and I'm really excited about coding and working on projects with other people.
After I graduate, I'm planning to jump into the workforce with all the skills I learned during my time at CSUSM. Being a student-athlete
has taught me how to manage my time and stay organized,which I think will be really helpful in my career.
